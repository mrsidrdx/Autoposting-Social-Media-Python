# Autoposting-Social-Media-Python
This is a python based autoposting social media script where one can automatically post images, text captions, an url directly to their social media accounts by just running the python script.

# Getting Started
First things first, let's install all the necessary modules for this project.<br>
Just clone this repository and open it in command line. Then type pip install -r requirements.txt and hit enter. All the required modules will be installed and ready to use.<br>
Or Do it manually for each of the module:<br>
1) Facebook API - pip install facebook-sdk<br>
2) Twitter API - pip install tweepy<br>
3) Selenium - pip install selenium<br>
4) Pandas - pip install pandas<br><br>

<strong>PERFECT!!</strong>

# How It Works?
Okay for testing purposes I have already added access tokens for my dummy facebook, twitter pages. So you don't need to worry about that but it's better if you do it on your own account/pages. For linkedin, we are gonna use selenium with chrome driver so make sure that you have downloaded chrome driver from here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.<br> Also I have also added login credentials for my linkedin dummy account.<br>
Now you are good to go. Just run the autopost.py script and play around with different functions. Type python autopost.py in command line and hit enter.<br><br>
